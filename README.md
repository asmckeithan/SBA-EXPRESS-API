Objective: 
1. Create a RESTful API using Express.
This to me was simple and seems as long as you have the right installation and configurations. It tends to become a simple process. 

2. Create Express middleware.
This is a bit tricky. Following the syntax I was able to create a time stamp function using middleware, along with some request and response callback funtions 

3. Use Express middleware.
   Will revist in the future. Simple to do for some callback functions. I am still learning the many options.
   
4. Use a template engine to render views with Express.
   The template engine was not bad to route, but I will definitely revist for future references to update data being implemented on the template 
Interact with a self-made API through HTML forms.
